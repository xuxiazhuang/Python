# string formatting
nums = [4, 5, 6]
msg = "Numbers: {0} {1} {2}". format(nums[0], nums[1], nums[2])
print(msg)

output:Numbers: 4 5 6


a = "{x}, {y}".format(x=5, y=12)
print(a)

output:5,12

##useful String Functions
join - joins a list of strings with another string as a separator. 
The method split is the opposite of join, turning a string with a certain separator into a list.
print(", ".join(["spam", "eggs", "ham"]))

output: spam, eggs, ham

print("spam, eggs, ham".split(", "))

output:['spam', 'eggs', 'ham']

print("spam, eggs, ham".split())

output:['spam,', 'eggs,', 'ham']


print("This is a sentence.".startswith("This"))
# prints "True"

print("This is a sentence.".endswith("sentence."))
# prints "True"

print("This is a sentence.".upper())
# prints "THIS IS A SENTENCE."

print("AN ALL CAPS SENTENCE".lower())
prints "an all caps sentence"


########Numeric Functions

# To find the maximum or minimum of some numbers or a list, you can use max or min.
# To find the distance of a number from zero (its absolute value), use abs.
# To round a number to a certain number of decimal places, use round.
# To find the total of a list, use sum.
# Some examples:


print(min(1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 2, 1))
print(max([1, 4, 9, 2, 5, 6, 8]))
print(abs(-99))
print(abs(42))
print(sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
print(round(7.896))
print(round(7.1266))
output:
0
9
99
42
15
8
7


##list functions
# all and any take a list as an argument, and return True if all or any (respectively) of their arguments evaluate to True (and False otherwise). 
# The function enumerate can be used to iterate through the values and indices of a list simultaneously.


nums = [55, 44, 33, 22, 11]

if all([i > 5 for i in nums]):
   print("All larger than 5")

if any([i % 2 == 0 for i in nums]):
   print("At least one is even")

for v in enumerate(nums):
   print(v)

output:
All larger than 5
At least one is even
(0, 55)
(1, 44)
(2, 33)
(3, 22)
(4, 11)

####text analyzer

filename = input("Enter a filename: ")

with open(filename) as f:
   text = f.read()

print(text)


###counts how many times a character occurs in a string.

def count_char(text,char):
	count = 0
	for c in text:
		if c==char:
			count += 1
		return count
filename = input('Entera file name:')
with open(filename) as f:
	text = f.read()
print (count_char(text,"r"))
