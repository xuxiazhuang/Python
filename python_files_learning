#opening files
#Before a file can be edited, it must be opened, using the open function.
myfile = open("filename.txt")
print (myfile)

# write mode
open("filename.txt", "w")

# read mode
open("filename.txt", "r")
open("filename.txt")

# binary write mode
open("filename.txt", "wb")


#close files
file = open("filename.txt", "w")
# do stuff to the file
file.close()
##read files
file = open("filename.txt", "r")
print(file.read(16))
print(file.read(4))
print(file.read(4))
print(file.read())
file.close()

#read lines
file = open("filename.txt", "r")
print(file.readlines())
file.close()

#To write to files you use the write method, which writes a string to the file

file = open("newfile.txt", "w")
file.write("This has been written to a file")
file.close()

file = open("newfile.txt", "r")
print(file.read())
file.close()

#When a file is opened in write mode, the file's existing content is deleted.

file = open("newfile.txt", "r")
print("Reading initial contents")
print(file.read())
print("Finished")
file.close()

file = open("newfile.txt", "w")
file.write("Some new text")
file.close()

file = open("newfile.txt", "r")
print("Reading new contents")
print(file.read())
print("Finished")
file.close()

output:
Reading initial contents
some initial text
Finished
Reading new contents
Some new text
Finished

##working with files
#It is good practice to avoid wasting resources by making sure that files are always closed after they have been used. One way of doing this is to use try and finally.
try:
   f = open("filename.txt")
   print(f.read())
finally:
   f.close()
